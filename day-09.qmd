#1. Use the help (?) function to learn more about the dataset
#2. Use vis_dat to check out the data. Does it need cleaning?
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(visdat)
?airquality
vis_dat(airquality)
```

#3. Fit a linear model to the cleaned data to predict Ozone from one of the possible predictors of your choosing. Why did you chose thats variable?
```{r}
airquality <- airquality %>% 
  drop_na()
model <- lm(Ozone ~ Temp, data = airquality)
summary(model)
```
