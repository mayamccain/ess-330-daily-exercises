#Part 1: Normality Testing

#Load the airquality dataset in R. What does this dataset represent? Explore its structure using functions like str() and summary().
```{r}
data(airquality)
str(airquality)
summary(airquality)
?airquality
```
#The airquality dataset represents New York daily air quality measurements from May to September of 1973. This dataset is a data frame with 153 observations of 6 variables. 

#Perform a Shapiro-Wilk normality test on the following variables: Ozone, Temp, Solar.R, and Wind.

#What is the purpose of the Shapiro-Wilk test?

#What are the null and alternative hypotheses for this test?

#Interpret the p-values. Are these variables normally distributed?
